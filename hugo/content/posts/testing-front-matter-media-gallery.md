## Static Site Search Functionality

I have been tasked with figuring how how to perform searches on our new static sites. While Forestry highly recommends Algolia, we will likely use either an open-source or in-house solution. One promising open-source approach is ElasticSearch, but before I start trying to implementing search functionality, I first need to prove that I indeed have content to search.
