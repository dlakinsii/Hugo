      <description>Static Site Search Functionality I have been tasked with figuring how how to perform searches on our new static sites. While Forestry highly recommends Algolia, we will likely use either an open-source or in-house solution. One promising open-source approach is ElasticSearch, but before I start trying to implement search functionality, I first need to prove that I indeed have content to search.
Linking to Content If you click this link it takes you to a 404 Error page, but you can right click and save, though I don&amp;rsquo;t know why anyone would need this file.</description>

      <description>I had a seemingly simple task of fixing a submit button that was allowing multiple submissions on one of our ASP.NET Web Forms sites. Getting the client and server to agree on when to disable the button proved problematic. I spent a few hours combined with a couple of more experienced developers on our team, and even tried to implement a similar solution from one of our other sites. I was stumped.</description>
